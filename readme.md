repo to automate finding cheap flights out of your home airport - want to go explore the world (but sadly i am on tight budget)

How to set up:

Download the script. 

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the required libraries

Get the amaedus API and secret, and get an app password from gmail 

Input those into the .env example file, and rename it just .env

Change the destination, origin or price(hopefully higher than my brokie price) according to your needs

set it up with github actions or cron or any task scheduler of your choice
